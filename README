There are a number of folders with shortcuts, I will list the github-repos linking to those repos, here

The JSON.lnk             folder is at [not yet created].
The Node.lnk             folder is at https://github.com/zyuvraj53/Node.git
The Tensorflow.lnk       folder has nothing in it.
The Three.js.lnk         folder is at [not yet created].
The Web Development.lnk  folder is at [not yet created].

There are also sub-modules in many of these folders.

There is also a downloaded website, of alexfoxy, which is kept in VanillaJS/laxxx.js, it has been put in the .gitignore

I do not currently know why the rellax with parallax is not being initialized.

All the folders which could not be uploaded to github due to cloned git repos will be in my drive of zyuvraj53@gmail.com, all of these folders are:

JSON
MochaAndChai
NODE.js
React.js
TypeScript
VanillaJS
